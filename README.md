# Java DSA Practice 🚀

This repository contains my personal journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. All code is written and tested in the Eclipse IDE.

## 📁 Structure

- `dsa.basics/` - Java basics (e.g., Hello World, loops, data types)
- `dsa.arrays/` - Array problems (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- `dsa.strings/` - String problems
- `dsa.sorting/` - Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort)

## 💡 Getting Started

To run the code:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open in Eclipse as a Java project.
3. Navigate to `src/dsa/...` and run any `.java` file.

## 🧠 Notes

- This is a learning repo.
- Code is structured by concept for easy navigation.
- Feel free to use or fork!
